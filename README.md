Parkinson Disease is a brain neurological disorder. It leads to shaking of the body, hands and provides stiffness to the body. No proper cure or treatment is available yet at the advanced stage. Treatment is possible only when done at the early or onset of the disease. These will not only reduce the cost of the disease but will also possibly save a life. Most methods available can detect Parkinson in an advanced stage; which means loss of approx.. 60% dopamine in basal ganglia and is responsible for controlling the movement of the body with a small amount of dopamine.
